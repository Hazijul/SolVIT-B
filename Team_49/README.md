## 📖 The Story Behind Seva.in  

In a world where technology has revolutionized stock trading, ride-hailing, and even grocery shopping, why is **hiring a skilled worker still so inefficient?**  

We met a carpenter named Raj, a master craftsman struggling to find steady work despite his **20+ years of experience**. His pricing was inconsistent—sometimes too low to sustain his family, sometimes too high to attract clients. Meanwhile, people in his city **paid absurdly high prices** for low-quality, unverified services.  

**This is where Seva.in comes in.**  

With a **dynamic pricing algorithm**, **real-time demand matching**, and **a decentralized service provider model**, Seva.in levels the playing field. Inspired by the **PM Vishwakarma Yojana**, we help skilled artisans like Raj **gain digital visibility, access stable work, and charge fair market rates** while ensuring customers get the best deals on top-quality services.  

The result? A **win-win ecosystem** that **empowers workers** and **delights customers.**
